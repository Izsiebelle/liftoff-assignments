## Submission Instructions

### Overview
On march 21st I was meant to host a city-wide hackathon for middle and high school aged girls for the KC metro area. Given recent circumstances that clearly didn't take place, but my team and I still want these girls to have an amazing experience and introduction to the world of tech. I am creating a virtual hackathon platform where girls can log on and find all of the resources that they need to participate in a, now 12 hour, hackathon. This web app will contain all the details of the hackathon, all the learning resources and all the fun of a hackathon. 

Girls will be able to log on and see the schedule that will link to all the resources they need for kick off, break out sessions, and wrap up. There will be a tab that contains different skills that the girls can choose to learn over the course of the hackathon. They will be able to search the skills that they are interested in. There will also be a tab that will include links to all the extra fun stuff that will be available for the girls to take part in. Yoga, zumba, meditation, Ted Talks, Tik Tok challenges and more. e are bringing the hackathon to them.  
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Skill Search: Users will be able to search the skills they are most interested in by language or by feature.
Instagram feed: Users will be able to see their photos being uploaded to the offical hackathon Instagram account in the fun tab.
